# linkedin-scraper
 
 a python script that i used while trying to analyze trends in the french (île de france) data market.

The script uses **BeautifulSoup4 (bs4)** to parse the html and css to find each job posting and it's related fields : 
* Job title
* Company Name 
* Location
* DatePosted

i also used the requests library to communicate with the linkedin hidden api

## TODO
* make the process fully automated
