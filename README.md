# linkedin-scraper
a python script that i used while trying to analyze trends in the french (île de france) data market.

The script uses **BeautifulSoup4 (bs4)** to parse the html and css to find each job posting and it's related fields : 
     * Job title
     * Company Name 
     * Location
     * DatePosted

i also used the requests library to communicate with the linkedin hidden api.
